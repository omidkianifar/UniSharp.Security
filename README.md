UniSharp.Security.Cryptography
A flexible and extensible cryptography library for Unity, supporting multiple encryption algorithms like DES and AES. This library allows developers to easily integrate encryption and decryption functionalities into Unity projects, with customizable options and Unity editor integration.

Features
Supported Algorithms:

DES (Data Encryption Standard)
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
AES-128
AES-192
AES-256
Unity Integration:

Configurable via ScriptableObject (CryptographySettings).
Easy runtime configuration with an intuitive API.
Customizable:

Use default keys or provide your own.
Supports extending for additional algorithms.
Installation
Clone or download this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UniSharp.Security.Cryptography.git
Add the UniSharp.Security.Cryptography folder to your Unity project's Assets directory.
Getting Started
Step 1: Configure Settings
Create a CryptographySettings asset:
In Unity, right-click in the Project window.
Select Create > UniSharp > Cryptography Settings.
Configure your default algorithm and keys.
Step 2: Create and Use a Cryptographer
Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a cryptographer and use it for encryption and decryption:

csharp
Copy code
using UniSharp.Security.Cryptography;

void Example()
{
    // Create an AES cryptographer
    var cryptographer = CryptoProvider.Create(options =>
    {
        options.Algorithm = AlgorithmType.AES128;
        options.Key1 = "YourAESKey123456"; // 16 bytes
        options.Key2 = "YourAESIV123456";  // 16 bytes
    });

    string plainText = "Hello, World!";
    string encrypted = cryptographer.Encrypt(plainText);
    string decrypted = cryptographer.Decrypt(encrypted);

    Debug.Log($"Plain Text: {plainText}");
    Debug.Log($"Encrypted: {encrypted}");
    Debug.Log($"Decrypted: {decrypted}");
}
APIs
CryptoProvider
Factory class for creating cryptographers.

csharp
Copy code
public static ICryptographer Create(Action<Options> setupAction = null);
setupAction: (Optional) Configure algorithm type, keys, etc.
ICryptographer
Interface for cryptographer implementations.

csharp
Copy code
string Encrypt(string plainText);
string Decrypt(string cipherText);
CryptographySettings
ScriptableObject for configuring default settings.

General Settings:
Default Algorithm: Set the default algorithm type.
DES Settings:
Public/Private keys (64-bit).
AES Settings:
Key and IV for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
Extending the Library
Add a new algorithm to the AlgorithmType enum.
Create a new cryptographer class inheriting from BaseCryptographer.
Add a case for your new algorithm in CryptoProvider.
